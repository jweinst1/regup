# Regup

A nifty SVG drawing library in Scala

## Installation

Regup is a scala package built with sbt. You can find the package under `src/main/scala/regup`.

## Usage

The documentation can be found [here](https://jweinst1.github.io/regup/target/scala-2.12/api/regup/index.html).

Regup makes drawing SVG paths and shapes easy. You can treat SVG as data and other abstractions. You can also synthesize SVG via continous calls of a Char and array of integers to represent path elements.
